# Re-run Workflow Action

This action allows re-running a workflow when labels are added to (or removed from) a pull request.


## Inputs

| Name | Required  | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `token` | yes | A GitHub Token other than the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` needs to be specified in order to be able to re-run workflows. |
| `once-label` | no\* | When this label is added to a pull request, re-run the `workflow` once and remove the label again. |
| `continuous-label` | no\* | When this label is added to a pull request, continuously re-run the `workflow` until it succeeds or is cancelled. The action needs to be run on `workflow_run`, `push` or `schedule` events for this to work. |
